At a crossroads brimming with people,
where will you go? (Being washed away)
Wearing the same clothes
wearing the same expression

Walking in a way that will get you inside the flock (without suspecting anything)
Why are you worrying about being different from someone else?

The people ahead turn to face you
and tell you to keep in line
They preach these rules,
but their eyes are dead

You have the freedom to be the way you are
Don't be controlled by adults
If people give up like that from the start
Then why were we even born in the first place
Having dreams means at times you'll be faced with loneliness
You have to walk an empty path
You won't get there even if the world is all the same
Are you really okay with Yes
Silent Majority

The president of some country once said (he lied)
Those who don't raise their voices are agreeing

Choosing is important
Don't leave it to others
If you don't take action,
they won't hear your No

You can be yourself, all you need is to do what you want
Don't be swayed by one of them
There are as many paths as there are people
You just have to walk your own way
Leave behind the boring adults who are kept in chains
By their appearances and pride
The future is for you all
Say No to them
Silent Majority

If you're just following someone
You won't get hurt, but
That crowd is just one mind
You'll be made one of them

You have the freedom to be the way you are
Don't be controlled by adults
If people give up like that from the start
Then why were we even born in the first place
Having dreams means at times you'll be faced with loneliness
You have to walk an empty path
You won't get there even if the world is all the same
Are you really okay with Yes
Silent Majority
