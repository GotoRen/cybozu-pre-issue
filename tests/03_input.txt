Two people
Two people
Fall in love in the spring and summer
Two people
Two people
Leave in autumn and winter
The season we spent together
Do you regret it?
Two people

Roadside blooming weeds
I forgot that I have a name
Even if you step on without being noticed
Existence that does not scream

It's a hassle to talk to someone
I was shaking my eyes and I couldn't hear
You suddenly
I removed my earphone

What did you say now?

By the time the sun comes back
I'm sure I can meet an important person
It's a waste to overlook
Don't refuse love

You are saison
You are saison
Appear in front of me
You are saison
You are saison
Make everyday shine
The scenery was different from yesterday
To change to live
You are saison
HA-

In the wind that blows through the city
It smelled like something
I can afford to look back
I was not interested

Own radius 1m
Another world with an invisible barrier
Such me
He took me out

What made you do that?

The momentary lights overlap
Occasional colors make the four seasons
Which one is missing
Eternity is not born

Two people
Two people
Fall in love in the spring and summer
Two people
Two people
Leave in autumn and winter
It's a ephemeral month and day
do not forget

Look up at the cherry blossoms without flowers
Have you ever thought of a day in full bloom?
I have to imagine
I can't dream
Window of heart

Spring, summer, fall, winter
I was taught by you

You are saison
You are saison
Appear in front of me
You are saison
You are saison
Make everyday shine

Two people
Two people
Fall in love in the spring and summer
Two people
Two people
Leave in autumn and winter
The crush I felt for the first time
Memories are calendars
Two people
HA-

I am also a saison
