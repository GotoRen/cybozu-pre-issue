I don't say Yes
I don't bob my head
Even everyone answers with a nod
I don't say Yes
I never hold my tongue
I resist till the end

I kill my screaming
There appears an unseen wall
I didn't think I would be a traitor unless I agree
and be shot by my company
Oh Oh

I hate it

I'm not scared of discord
Even I would be hated
I have my own justice
You could beat me
Once I compromise, it means death
If you want to control me
Go after I fall down

Do you say Yes?
Are you going to be beaten?
You know it is unreasonable
Do you say Yes?
You throw your pride way then
What makes you scared to say No

It is a fury
held down with its huge power
Don't you call me your friend unless I ignore it?
I believed a voice of the truth could reach to you
Oh Oh

I hate it

With Discord
Break down the stereotype
It is strange
if we all have the same opinions
Carry out your will
If you change you opinion, you are not worth living
If you want to deceive me
Go after you kill me

It is dangerous only with harmony
No kidding! You don't admit liberty?
Everyone is different
We notice it when something goes out of order
We notice a new world

I hate it
With Discord
Break down the stereotype
It is strange
if we all have the same opinions
Carry out your will
If you change you opinion, you are not worth living
If you want to deceive me
Go after you kill me

I'm not scared of discord
Even I would be hated
I have my own justice
You could beat me
Once I compromise, it means death
If you want to control me
Go after I fall down

Discord Discord
Yeah! Discord
